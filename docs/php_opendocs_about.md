# About PHP OpenDocs

One of the problems with the PHP manual site is that it is a monolithic repo.

This means that all curation decisions need to go through a single nexus.


Instead of having all content under a single repo, OpenDocs is an experient in delegating 


## Principles

### Site must be self-contained

So it can be archived, shipped on CD, inspected for appropriate content.

### Content must be forkable


### Content must be remixable
