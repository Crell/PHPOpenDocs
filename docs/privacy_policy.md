# Privacy policy

Apparently, people expect a site to have a privacy policy, rather than just not invading other people's privacy. So here is the privacy policy.

## Tracking cookies

This site will never use 3rd party tracking cookies. If you do ever see any third party cookies on this site, please report it as a security problem, as it means that site may have been hacked.

## Functional cookies

This site may store functional cookies that allow basic site functionality to work. An example of this would be a cookie to remember font size or color preferences. These cookies will never track user activity.

## Visitor statistics

Visitor statistics will be stored as data aggregated to state and/or country.

## IP logging for security

That data will only be used for protecting the stability and security of the site e.g. blocking DOS attacks, or repeated password guessing attempts. This data will be stored for a maximum of 7 days.
