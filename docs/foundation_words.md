PHP is and should remain:
1) a pragmatic web-focused language
2) a loosely typed language
3) a language which caters to the skill-levels and platforms of a wide range of users

For a foundation to form, or a campaign to be run, or any other marketing strategy to be employed, there would have to be someone in charge. There is nobody in charge. Nobody has the authority to do that stuff, and I hope they never do.

## What could work


doing the boring work of maintaining docs, triaging bugs and all the other stuff that makes the project better, but isn't 'glamorous' could really do with a paid staff that work on it regularly.

yeah......but still, it's the type of thing that could usefully be done by someone paid to do it, who also improves tools around how to report bugs or make repro cases.....rather than each time it taking away from core dev effort.

making any funding be for the boring stuff, and possibly not giving those people a vote by default, would avoid any potential problem with money being used to influence the project too much.
